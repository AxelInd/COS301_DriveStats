Discussion

* Issues related to ORM mapping of arrays
* Getting accelerometer data outside of normal ranges
* How to nromalise algorithm against database


Decisions
* Dropped ORM mapping and arrays, normalised database instead.
* No build environment is necessary (server side) as Visual Studio is the only functional C# platform
* Branch creation for each function



Ongoing Issues
* Getting full team together
* Github URL appears to disappear spontaneously
* No viable build environment
* Trouble getting speed limits for roads
* Google login
