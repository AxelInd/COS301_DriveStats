Google Sign-In recommended for Web and application:
  Google Sign-In is a secure authentication system that reduces the burden of login for your users,
  by enabling them to sign in with their Google account—the same account they already use with Gmail,
  Play, Google+, and other Google services.

  Google Sign-In is also your gateway to connecting with Google’s users and services in a secure manner. 
  You can give your users the opportunity to pay with Android Pay, share with their Google-wide contacts,
  save a file to Drive, add an event to Calendar, and more. Integrate Google’s user-centric APIs
  and services inside your app to help your users take action and convert.
